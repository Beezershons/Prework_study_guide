# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A website that was built as a guide and learing experience

This is a website built with the intent of learning the basics of some of the coding languages including HTML, CSS and Java Script,
giving some hands on experience with said languages. I built this project to learn and create experience in coding. Through this project I learned how to debug a website, add and access the console to a website through Java Script, write if and for loop codes, Use CSS to make a website more individualized and use HTML to create the core building blocks of a website.

The website contains a section for each of the 4 things that were explored and used including Git, Java Script, CSS, and HTML. Each section has notes on these topics and you can even use the DevTools console to see Java Script running. It will list the topics learned from the prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
